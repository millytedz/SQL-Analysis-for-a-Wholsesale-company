# SQL-Analysis-for-a-Wholsesale-company
Using SQL to analyze a wholesale company database

A fictional wholesale company database was queried using MySQL Workbench. The database consist of product and order where some key insights were drawn to help the company make informed decisions.


- The most ordered product was Gorgonzola Telino with 822 quantities ordered, this doesnt generate much revenue though as the unit price on order is $10. The highest revenue came from Côte de Blaye with total $73,569 made. Since Côte de Blaye has a high unit price with moderate quantity ordered, improvements could be made to increase its order in some cities in order to generate more revenue.

- Cunewalde city in Germany is most performing city in terms of revenue generated and improvement can still be made with promotions, loyalty points e.t.c to retain and generate more customers in the region and country generally. Some european cities underperformed i.e Helsinki and Torino. Emphasis and further analysis should be done in order to improve orders and revenue considering the shipping cost to the regions.
